<!-- High-Level Architecture -->

## High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture](./images/03-BrainDev-BrainRehab-HLA.png)

- On our users side or the front-end portion of the Diagram (the left) there are three types of users for the app. The Admin and Therapist users will typically be a dashboard portion and a patient view which will ideally be run on a mobile device using NextPWA (Progressive Web Application). 
- We are using Firebase as our backend for authentication and data storage using a JSON data format.
- We are using ChartJS to integrate chart technology and tailwind css for the styling on every part of the front end.

<!-- Technical Research -->

## Technical Research

[Technical Research Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJuTw1EakxJdmso2JJG-lz8Oa6ryuC1J/)

- Next.JS (next-pwa): Out of the box solution for building a PWA. Includes pre-configured SW, workbox, cache with fallbacks, maximum lighthouse score, among other features. It offers better performance compared to React.JS, it also makes the development faster compared to using Vanilla JavaScript. But, most important, it will meet the project requirements and consequently client’s needs

- Firebase: Platform backed by Google. It will be used for data storage (Firestore) and authentication. It is safe with a server located in Canada (northamerica-northeast1 – located in Montreal, QC) which meets the requirement that data needs to stay in Canada. 

- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework with a very modern look and states out of the box. It installs as a package in NextJS. It will also help build a fully responsive and modern dashboard.

- Charts.js: Open-source library used to create charts. Includes 8 chart types (and mixed chart types), animations and it’s fully responsive. 

- Limitations: Although PWA works on every platform, based on the functional requirements (previously described) some of its functionalities are not supported by devices using iOS (ie: iPhones and iPads):
